House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

But then all of a sudden he realizes that life is too short to worry about navigating court politics, and sells all of the holdings of Winterfell (including his wife and children) to the highest bidder, Jorah Mormont. Using his new found cashmoney, he charters a boat to take him to the Summer Isles, where he lives a life of debauchery until the end of his days.
